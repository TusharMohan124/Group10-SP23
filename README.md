"Guppy Guru" - a fish tank simulator web-app meant to allow users to interact with virtual fish in a tank. This group project was done for my CS124 Honors section at UIUC. 

I mainly worked on the 3D random movement and pellet-chasing behavior of the fish in the "Feed your Fish" section of the web-app.
